# nodejs

> This library helps you deploy [a NodeJS app](https://nodejs.org) to your cluster.
NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and is designed to be lightweight and efficient. To that end, it uses an event-driven, non-blcoking I/O model. NodeJS also has a large ecosystem of open-source packages, which can be managed with the npm tool.

  * [io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-simple](#io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-simple)

Specifically, the *nodejs* library files provide:
* A set of relevant **parts** (_e.g._, deployments, services, secrets, and so on) that can be combined to configure a NodeJS app for a wide variety of scenarios.

* A set of **prototypes**, which are pre-fabricated "flavors" (or "distributions") of *nodejs*, each configured for a different use case. By passing in certain parameters, users can interactively customize these prototypes for their specific needs.

## Quickstart

*Using the [`io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-simple`](io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-simple) prototype, the following commands generate the Kubernetes YAML for a NodeJS app, and then deploys it to your Kubernetes cluster.*

1. First, create a cluster and install the ksonnet CLI (see root-level [README.md](rootReadme)).

2. If you haven't yet created a [ksonnet application](linkToSomewhere), do so using `ks init <app-name>`.

3. Finally, in the ksonnet application directory, run the following:

```shell
# Expand prototype as a Jsonnet file, place in a file in the
# `components/` directory. (YAML and JSON are also available.)
$ ks prototype use io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-simple nodejs \
  --namespace default \
  --name nodejs

# Apply to server.
$ ks apply -f nodejs.jsonnet
```

## Prototype Reference

The set of available prototypes are enumerated below.

  * [io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-simple](#io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-simple)

### io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-nonpersistent

When generated and applied, this prototype deploys a stateless node.js app. Its source code is available at https://github.com/jbianquetti-nami/simple-node-app. The app runs as a Deployment, and is exposed to the network using a Service.

#### Example

```shell
# Expand prototype as a Jsonnet file, place in a file in the
# `components/` directory. (YAML and JSON are also available.)
$ ks prototype use io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-nonpersistent nodejs \
  --namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE \
  --name YOUR_NAME_HERE
```

Below is the Jsonnet file generated by this command.

```
// nodejs.jsonnet
<JSONNET HERE>
```

#### Parameters

The available options to pass to the prototype are:

| Name | Type | Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--namespace` | *string* | Namespace (metadata) that the app resources are created under |
| `--name` | *string* | Name (metadata) to identify all resources defined by this prototype |
### io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-simple

When generated and applied, this prototype deploys a node.js app backed by a PersistentVolumeClaim. Its source code is available at https://github.com/jbianquetti-nami/simple-node-app. The app runs as a Deployment, and is exposed to the network using a Service.

#### Example

```shell
# Expand prototype as a Jsonnet file, place in a file in the
# `components/` directory. (YAML and JSON are also available.)
$ ks prototype use io.ksonnet.pkg.nodejs-simple nodejs \
  --namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE \
  --name YOUR_NAME_HERE
```

Below is the Jsonnet file generated by this command.

```
// nodejs.jsonnet
<JSONNET HERE>
```

#### Parameters

The available options to pass to the prototype are:

| Name | Type | Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--namespace` | *string* | Namespace (metadata) that the app resources are created under |
| `--name` | *string* | Name (metadata) to identify all resources defined by this prototype |
