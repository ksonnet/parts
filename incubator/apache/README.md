# apache

> This library helps you deploy [an Apache server](https://httpd.apache.org/) to your cluster.
Apache is a popular, open-source HTTP server.


* [Quickstart](#quickstart)
* [Prototype Reference](#prototype-reference)
  * [io.ksonnet.pkg.apache-simple](#io.ksonnet.pkg.apache-simple)

Specifically, the *apache* library files provide:
* A set of relevant **parts** (_e.g._, deployments, services, secrets, and so on) that can be combined to configure an Apache server for a wide variety of scenarios.

* A set of **prototypes**, which are pre-fabricated "flavors" (or "distributions") of *apache*, each configured for a different use case. By passing in certain parameters, users can interactively customize these prototypes for their specific needs.

## Quickstart

*Using the [`io.ksonnet.pkg.apache-simple`](io.ksonnet.pkg.apache-simple) prototype, the following commands generate the Kubernetes YAML for an Apache server, and then deploys it to your Kubernetes cluster.*

1. First, create a cluster and install the ksonnet CLI (see root-level [README.md](rootReadme)).

2. If you haven't yet created a [ksonnet application](linkToSomewhere), do so using `ks init <app-name>`.

3. Finally, in the ksonnet application directory, run the following:

```shell
# Expand prototype as a Jsonnet file, place in a file in the
# `components/` directory. (YAML and JSON are also available.)
$ ks prototype use io.ksonnet.pkg.apache-simple apache \
  --name apache \
  --namespace default

# Apply to server.
$ ks apply -f apache.jsonnet
```

## Prototype Reference

The set of available prototypes are enumerated below.

  * [io.ksonnet.pkg.apache-simple](#io.ksonnet.pkg.apache-simple)

### io.ksonnet.pkg.apache-simple

When generated and applied, this prototype runs Apache HTTP Server as a Deployment, and exposes it to the network using a Service.

#### Example

```shell
# Expand prototype as a Jsonnet file, place in a file in the
# `components/` directory. (YAML and JSON are also available.)
$ ks prototype use io.ksonnet.pkg.apache-simple apache \
  --namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE \
  --name YOUR_NAME_HERE
```

Below is the Jsonnet file generated by this command.

```
// apache.jsonnet
<JSONNET HERE>
```

#### Parameters

The available options to pass to the prototype are:

| Name | Type | Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--namespace` | *string* | Namespace (metadata) that the Apache resources are created under; default is 'default' |
| `--name` | *string* | Name (metadata) to identify all resources defined by this prototype |
